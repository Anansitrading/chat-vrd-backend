# Railway Deployment Issue - Debugging Summary

## Issue Description
The chat-vrd-backend was showing as "Active" in Railway but returning **404 "Application not found"** with `x-railway-fallback: true` when accessing endpoints.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Missing PORT Environment Variable Logging
- The server logs showed "Server starting on port 8000" instead of the dynamic Railway `$PORT`
- Railway requires apps to bind to the port specified in the `$PORT` environment variable
- Without proper PORT binding, Railway's edge proxy cannot route traffic to the container

### Problem 2: Missing nixpacks.toml Configuration  
- Railway was using auto-detection without explicit Python configuration
- No explicit configuration for Python 3.12 and dependencies

### Problem 3: pip Command Not Found (CRITICAL)
- Build was failing with: `/bin/bash: line 1: pip: command not found`
- Initial nixpacks.toml used `python312` which does NOT include pip
- **Solution**: Use `python312Full` which bundles pip, setuptools, and standard Python tools

## Changes Made

### 1. Added PORT Environment Variable Debugging (server.py)
```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    # CRITICAL: Log the PORT environment variable for debugging
    port = os.getenv('PORT')
    logger.info(f"üîß PORT environment variable: {port}")
    if not port:
        logger.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: PORT environment variable is NOT SET!")
        logger.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è  Railway requires $PORT to be set for routing")
```

### 2. Created nixpacks.toml Configuration
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python312Full", "gcc", "pkg-config"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["pip install --upgrade pip", "pip install -r requirements.txt"]

[start]
cmd = "uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
```

**Key Point**: Must use `python312Full` NOT `python312` to get pip included!

### 3. Updated .gitignore
Added `daily-js-daily-js-*` to prevent unnecessary files from being committed.

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Railway Build Logs**: Verify pip is found during install phase
2. **Check Railway Deploy Logs**: Look for PORT environment variable value
3. **Test Health Endpoint**: 
   ```bash
   curl https://kijko-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   Should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "service": "pipecat-gemini-bot",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "daily_api_configured": true,
     "google_api_configured": true,
     "bot_available": true
   }
   ```

## Expected Log Output After Fix

After successful deployment, Railway logs should show:
```
üöÄ Starting Chat-VRD Pipecat Backend...
üîß PORT environment variable: [random_port_number]
‚úÖ Bot module loaded successfully
‚úÖ All required environment variables configured
‚úÖ Startup complete - ready to accept connections
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:[random_port_number]
```

## Railway Configuration Files

- **Procfile**: `web: uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **railway.json**: Specifies Nixpacks builder and start command
- **nixpacks.toml**: Explicit Python 3.12 configuration with pip support

## Test HTML File Location
`/home/david/Projects/chat-vrd/test-railway-backend.html`

## Commits
1. `Fix Railway PORT variable binding issue` - Added debugging and nixpacks.toml
2. `Fix nixpacks pip not found error - use python312Full` - FAILED (pip still not found)
3. `Remove custom nixpacks.toml - let Railway auto-detect Python` - CORRECT FIX

## Final Solution

**The issue was:** Custom nixpacks.toml was preventing Railway from properly setting up Python virtual environment and pip.

**The fix:** Remove nixpacks.toml entirely and let Railway auto-detect Python from requirements.txt.

## Current Status (as of last check)

App logs show:
```
‚úÖ Bot module loaded successfully
‚úÖ All required environment variables configured
üîß PORT environment variable: 8000
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
INFO: Application startup complete
```

**App is running successfully!**

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED!

**Final Steps Taken:**
1. Deleted custom PORT=8000 environment variable from Railway dashboard
2. Let Railway auto-assign PORT (now using 8080)
3. Generated new public domain in Railway Settings ‚Üí Networking

**New Public URL:** https://chat-vrd-backend-production.up.railway.app

**Health Check Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "pipecat-gemini-bot",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "daily_api_configured": true,
  "google_api_configured": true,
  "bot_available": true
}
```

**Backend is now fully operational and accessible!**
