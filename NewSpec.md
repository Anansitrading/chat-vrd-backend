# please refine to ensure that the Agent preserves the working language detection which is operated by deepgram just at the moment the user clicks the mic , the language is detected in under 300ms and this triggers the correct language for the STT transcription.

Here is a refined, paste‑ready prompt that preserves Deepgram language detection at mic press (≤300 ms) and feeds the detected language into STT across desktop and Live modes without regressing the current PC STT flow.[^11][^12]

System
Design and implement a minimal, safe UX refinement that adds a conspicuous “Go Live” mode for real‑time conversation while preserving the current desktop STT experience, with a hard requirement to keep the existing Deepgram‑based language detection that runs immediately at mic press and returns a language within 300 ms to configure STT for the session.[^12][^11]

Objectives

- Provide identical chat semantics across models: always render a user transcript and an assistant transcript in the thread, even if the model streams audio first.[^11][^12]
- Add a red “Go Live” toggle that enables hands‑free conversation: while Live is on, the agent listens and responds continuously without “Send,” and attachments auto‑post to the chat context as soon as they are added.[^12][^11]
- Preserve the working desktop AudioWorklet path and non‑Live behavior, changing nothing outside the Live feature and transcript parity improvements.[^11][^12]

Deepgram language detection (hard requirement)

- Trigger language detection the instant the mic is pressed by capturing a short 200–300 ms audio sample and calling the existing Deepgram detection path, with a strict 300 ms timeout budget for a result before starting the STT session.[^12][^11]
- Treat Deepgram’s detected language as the single source of truth for the session and map it to a BCP‑47 code, then pass it into the chosen STT path before any user audio is streamed to the model.[^11][^12]
- If detection exceeds 300 ms or fails, fall back to the last successful language for this client, otherwise fall back to the default language, and update the UI banner non‑disruptively while allowing the STT flow to proceed.[^12][^11]
- Desktop path: start the AudioWorklet/WebSocket STT with the detected BCP‑47 language code and keep all other desktop behavior unchanged.[^11][^12]
- Live on Android path: start Daily/Pipecat with the detected language parameter so Gemini Live (or the configured model) receives the correct language in its speech config up front, avoiding mid‑session reconfiguration and ensuring proper UserTranscript/BotTranscript events.[^12][^11]

Transcripts parity

- Always render interim and final transcripts for both user and assistant in both modes, upgrading interim to final in place to avoid duplicate lines and ensuring the thread stays skimmable even when audio is playing.[^11][^12]
- Normalize message objects across transports with fields for role, text, interim/final state, timestamps, and source so the UI is model‑agnostic and stable.[^12][^11]

Live mode UX

- Toggling “Go Live” switches to hands‑free turn‑taking without requiring “Send,” and attachments auto‑post a context message and are included in the next model turn automatically.[^11][^12]
- While Live is on, repurpose or disable the Send button to prevent double‑submission and reflect Live state clearly in the control, with safe exit back to Normal mode without losing context.[^12][^11]

Non‑regression and scope control

- Do not modify the working desktop AudioWorklet capture, buffering, downsampling, or start/stop semantics outside the language plumbing described above.[^11][^12]
- Constrain code changes to the chat UI, live hook, and model/transport glue, reusing existing env/config and the known Deepgram→BCP‑47 mapping utilities already present in the project.[^12][^11]

Acceptance criteria

- On mic press, Deepgram detects language in ≤300 ms and the session config uses that language before audio streaming starts for both desktop and Live routes, with a recorded log of the language used and any fallback applied.[^11][^12]
- Normal mode is unchanged: click mic, see interim transcription, click Send to submit, receive assistant response with no performance or quality regression on desktop.[^12][^11]
- Live mode: the red “Go Live” button enables hands‑free operation, auto‑posts attachments, and renders continuous interim/final user and assistant transcripts without duplication or “double words,” including on Android with the Daily/Pipecat route.[^11][^12]
- Gemini Live parity: input and output transcription is enabled so UserTranscript and BotTranscript events map cleanly into the unified message schema with correct interim→final promotion.[^12][^11]

Telemetry and logs

- Log mic press timestamp, detection duration, detected language, fallback path if any, chosen transport/model, and interim→final promotions, segmented by desktop vs Live/Android for debugging and QA verification.[^11][^12]
